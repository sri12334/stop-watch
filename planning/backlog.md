## Must-Haves

1. **HTML Structure**:
   - Create the necessary HTML structure for the stopwatch UI.

2. **CSS Styling**:
   - Apply CSS styles to achieve the desired layout and appearance.
   - Add rounded borders to the timer display using the `border-radius` property.

3. **JavaScript Functionality**:
   - Implement JavaScript functions to handle the stopwatch functionality:
     - Start, stop, and reset the timer.
     - Update the timer display with elapsed time.

4. **Timer Logic**:
   - Calculate and update the timer display (minutes, seconds, milliseconds) based on the elapsed time.
   - Ensure the timer updates every millisecond when running.

5. **Event Handling**:
   - Add event listeners to control buttons (start, stop, reset) to trigger corresponding functions.
   - Handle user interactions such as button clicks to control the stopwatch.

## Should-Haves

1. **Testing and Debugging**:
   - Test the stopwatch functionality to ensure correct behavior (start, stop, reset).
   - Debug any issues or unexpected behavior encountered during testing.

2. **Refinement**:
   - Refine the design and functionality based on user feedback or additional requirements.
   - Optimize code for performance and readability.

## Could-Haves

1. **Documentation**:
   - Document the code with comments to explain the purpose of each function and section.
   - Provide instructions or usage guidelines for users interacting with the stopwatch.

2. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the stopwatch application to a live environment (web server, hosting platform) for user access.
