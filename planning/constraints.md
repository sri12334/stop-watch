# Constraints

## Time Constraints

- **Deadline**: The stopwatch project must be completed within one day.

## Technical Constraints

- **Basic Functionality**: Focus on implementing essential stopwatch functionality (start, stop, reset) within the limited timeframe.
- **Simplicity**: Keep the codebase simple and straightforward to minimize development time and complexity.
- **Browser Compatibility**: Ensure basic functionality works across major web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

## Resource Constraints

- **Limited Development Time**: Utilize available development time efficiently, prioritizing essential tasks over non-essential features.
- **Skills and Expertise**: Leverage existing skills and knowledge to complete the project quickly without requiring extensive learning or training.

## User Constraints

- **Basic User Interface**: Design a simple user interface with clear controls for starting, stopping, and resetting the stopwatch.
- **Ease of Use**: Prioritize usability by ensuring intuitive interactions and clear feedback for users.

## Environmental Constraints

- **Offline Functionality**: Aim for basic offline functionality to allow users to use the stopwatch without internet connectivity.
- **Device Compatibility**: Test the stopwatch on different devices to ensure responsiveness and functionality across various screen sizes.
