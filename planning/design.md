### Design Plan:

1. **User Interface (UI)**:
   - Utilize the existing HTML structure with a stopwatch icon and timer display.
   - Implement clear and intuitive buttons for start, stop, and reset functionalities.

2. **Layout**:
   - Maintain the current layout with the stopwatch icon, timer display, and control buttons.
   - Ensure proper alignment and spacing for a neat appearance.

3. **Color Scheme**:
   - Use the existing color scheme from the CSS with adjustments for better contrast if needed.
   - Maintain consistency with the current design for a cohesive look.
